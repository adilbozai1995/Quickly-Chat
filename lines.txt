Account security is taken very seriously by Quickly Chat. Passwords are hashed
using sha512. Salts for those passwords are randomized per account using 32
bytes of cryptographically random data. Once the password is confirmed to match
a random 32 byte string is generated for use as an authentication token. For all
further transactions, this token is used to verify the identity of the user.
This ensures that their password is never stored in plaintext. The token is
automatically regenerated on every login, this ensures that if an attacker is
able to clone a token, then it will only last until the original user decides to
login to back into their account.

Messages are fetched from the backend ever second through the use of a polling
method. This polling loop makes an AJAX request to the backend every second and
the backend returns any new messages that have yet to be recieved by the client.
Both posting and fetching messages requires a valid username and token pair.
This ensures that all users of Quickly Chat have accounts, and ensures robust
logging of all server transactions.
